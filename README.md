#### Android App Developer

As an Android app developer, I find joy in writing code that combines creativity with problem-solving.
With 3 years of experience, Iâ€™m proficient in a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Android Studio, XML, Firebase, Android SDK, ADS, and all the best practices required for modern app development.
Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve gained experience in planning, designing, developing, testing, fixing bugs, and brainstorming the best ideas for applications, as well as collaborating with teams to achieve project goals.
My expertise in Android development has enabled me to construct highly scalable apps that deliver seamless user experiences. Iâ€™m constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and take on challenges. Iâ€™m excited to bring my passion for technology and expertise to a new team.
If youâ€™re interested in learning more about my experience, coding style, or anything else, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out. I would love to connect with you and share my insights, or to hear about your own experiences and perspectives.
Very comfortable with Java, Android Studio, XML, Firebase, Android SDK, Server and API, and more.
